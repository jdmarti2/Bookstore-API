# Bookstore-API

#### In this project I learned how to build fast, secure and documented API with python.


In this project, I learned how to build secure, fast, scalable, documented and well tested API. I also learned the caching 
and database best practices. This is not just an API framework project, this is complete project that taught me everything 
about backend development. You will see the best path of how to develop a good API.

In this project I used fastapi python framework. It is the fastest and most convenient python framework.
As a production environment I used digital-ocean cloud and as a deployment mechanism I used docker. 
 
I also got a domain name and put it to my API server. With load balancer, millions of users will be no more trouble. 
With nginx reverse proxy, I will be able to set any security or rate limit configuration to your API.
